# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):This is the study of computer science that involves design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.
Software engineering follows a development process where the software is continuously refined and improved based on the users feedback whereas traditional engineering typically follow a more linear process where designs are finalized before the construction begins.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Phase 1: Planning- The developer prepares himself and his environment to develop a software 
Phase 2: Requirements analysis -  in this stage, the developer lists down all the resource needed to develop a software                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Phase 3: Design  here, the development of a mind map takes place                                                                                                                   Phase 4: Coding   -Involves writing codes used to develop the software                                                                                                                   Phase 5: Testing   - Dry run of the formulated codes to access viability is done and correction of the codes where necessary                                                                                                                 
Phase 6: Development - involves formulation of a viable software product.                                                                                                         
Phase 7: Maintenance - involves checking regularly the performance of the software including reinforcement of the fire wall for protection.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
This is the process of identifying, analyzing, specifying, validating and managing the needs and expectations of software system stakeholders.
The processes are as follows:
1.Feasibility study
2.Requirements elicitation
3.Requirements specification
4.Requirements for verification and validation
5.Requirements management
The processes help ensure that the software system is delivered on time within a budget and to the required quality standards.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
This refers to breaking down a system into smaller and self-contained units or modules. It improves maintainability and scalability by allowing developers to easily modify or add modules without affecting the system.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
Unit testing mainly focuses on verifying the correctness of small code units and stubs can be used to simulate dependencies.                                                  Interrogation testing is used to test the interaction between different modules of code. It also helps identify defects and interrogations issues.                         System training tests the entire software as it verifies that the system meets specified requirements and behaves as it is supposed to be in various scenarios.        Acceptance testing ensures that the software meets business requirements and is ready for deployment.
Testing is crucial as ensures the software meets quality standards and satisfies user expectations. 

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
Version control systems are tools that help the software team manage changes to source code over time. It serves as a safety net to protect the source code from harm without fear of creating code conflicts.                                                                                                     Examples are: 
1.Git- It is the widely used controlled system as it allows developers to collaborate on projects and enables easy branching and merging.
2.Subversion- It tracks changes to files and directories overtime and often used in centralized workflows.
Mercurial- Allows developers to track changes to code overtime and collaborate effectively.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:
The key aspects are project planning, resource management and team leadership.   They are responsible for overseeing all aspects of the project cycle and ensuring that it is completed on time and within budget.
The challenges faced are scope creep, as it is common for project requirements to expand or change overtime. 
Limited resources such as time and budget can pose significant challenges.
Managing stakeholder expectations and obtaining buy-in can be troublesome.


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
Software maintenance is the ongoing process of managing and updating software to ensure its continued functionality and relevance throughout it lifecycle.

The different maintenance activities are:
1.Corrective maintenance- this includes addressing and fixing errors identified during the use of the software.
2.Adaptive maintenance- this involves making changes to the software to keep it compatible with evolving hardware, software or environmental requirements.
Perfective maintenance- it focuses on improving the performance and efficiency of the software.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Some of the issues are:
1.Privacy concerns- challenge are faces regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information.
2.Environmental Impact- the development and operation of software can have environmental consequences such as increased energy, consumption or electronic waste.
3.Social Impact- software engineers may face dilemmas related to potential effects of technology on society such as job displacement.
Software engineers should:
1.Understand ethnical guidelines
2.Seek input and feedback
3.Being transparent and honest
4.Seeking ethnical guidance
5.Continuously reflect and improve ethnical decision-making processes and outcomes regularly

Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
